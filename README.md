# web-dev repository

I made this repository for making my own portfolio currently I have only made a brief demo website using bits and pieces of knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It is a full fledged website with responsiveness and links and buttons to specific locations.

Enjoy surfing the web.
